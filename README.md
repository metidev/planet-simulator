# Planet Simulator

![Preview](https://github.com/metidev/planet-simulator/blob/main/planets.gif)

This repository contains a Planet Simulator written in Python using the PyGame library. The simulator allows you to simulate a solar system with planets, their orbits, rotations, and movement. It's a graphics programming example that provides an interactive way to explore the dynamics of celestial bodies.

## Getting Started

To run the Planet Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Install Python 3.x on your system if not already installed.
2. Install the PyGame library by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/metidev/planet-simulator.git
   ```
4. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory:
   ```
   cd planet-simulator
   ```
5. Run the simulation by executing the `planets.py` script:
   ```
   python solar.py
   ```

## Features

- Simulate the orbits and rotations of planets in a solar system.
- Adjust the viewpoint to explore the simulated universe.
- Interact with the simulation to better understand the movements of planets.
